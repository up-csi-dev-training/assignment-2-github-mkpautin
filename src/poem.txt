"The Eternal Melody of Love"

In days of yore, when sun did gleam,
When knights in armor chased a dream,
There bloomed a love in meadow green,
A tale of passion, yet unseen.

Through verdant fields and winding lanes,
Two hearts entwined in sweet refrains,
In whispers soft, their vows were sworn,
As love, like ivy, gently worn.

The moon above, a witness true,
To love that sparkled like the dew,
In olden tongue, they spoke their truth,
A dance of hearts, eternal youth.

Upon the morrow, love did grow,
A flame that warmed through frost and snow,
Through troth and trials, hand in hand,
Their love, a fortress, strong and grand.

In shadows cast by castle towers,
They strolled amidst the fragrant flowers,
With words unspoken, deeply felt,
A love that ancient tales had dwelt.

Forsooth, in love's enduring gaze,
They wandered through the ancient maze,
With tender touches, soft and sweet,
A love that time could not defeat.

So let the minstrels sing their song,
Of love that lasts the ages long,
In olden English, hearts entwined,
A timeless tale of love defined.
